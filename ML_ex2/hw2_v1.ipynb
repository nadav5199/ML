    "* HW assignments are a significant part of the learning experience in this course and contribute 50% to your final grade. So, make sure to devote the appropriate time to them.\n",
    "* **Sharing solutions with someone who is not your submitting partner is strictly prohibited**. This includes reading someone else's code or sharing your code / posting it somewhere.\n",

    "### Guidelines for Programming Exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complete the required functions in `hw2.py`. Any modifications to this notebook will not be tested by our automated tests.\n",
    "* Write **efficient**, **vectorized** code whenever possible. Some calculations in this exercise can take several minutes when implemented efficiently, but will take much longer otherwise. Unnecessary loops will result in point deductions.\n",
    "* You are responsible for the correctness of your code. You can add tests to this jupyter notebook to validate your solution. The contents of this jupyter notebook will not be graded or checked.\n",
    "* You are allowed to use functions and methods from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), numpy and pandas only. **Do not import anything else.**\n",
    "* Use `numpy` version 1.15.4 or higher.\n",

    "### Guidlines for Theoretical Exercises\n",
    "* Your solution should be written or typed and submitted in a separate file `hw2.pdf`.\n",
    "* If you scan a handwritten solution, make sure that your handwriting is legible and the scan quality is good.\n",
    "* You are expected to solve the questions analytically and provide a step-by-step solution. \n",
    "* It is okay and often recommended to use python to carry out the computations. \n",
